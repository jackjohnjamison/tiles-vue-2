# vue-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## TODO
- Organise CSS, sass of css variables? Maybe just pick one
- Think about prettier and css linting
- Switch to enums for game modes, maybe
- Use the improved image import script from tanks - looks harder than I thought!
- Make the editor tabs accesible, maybe more the sections up a level, re-use CSS,
they should poobably have a consistant width most of the time at least
- Move about the edit UI to be more sensible before it gets oot of control
- Move Math.round into common draw function?
- Add TypeScript, maybe just for the pinia stores to begin with?
