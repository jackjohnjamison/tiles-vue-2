## TODO
- Move all get element calls to refs
- Organise CSS, sass of css variables? Maybe just pick one
- Decide what to do with imports, should the be all @/lib etc. Maybe move game up to lib as there is nothing else in the lib file
- Think about prettier and css linting
- Switch to enums for game modes
- Use the improved image import script from tanks
